    You find yourself in an expansive field, surrounded by yellow knee-high grass. The sun is shining. You walk, trying to find the limits and extents, any kind of landmark for your mental map. The field is immense - you try but you can’t see the end of it. Crouching down, you examine the yellow grass. You see three or four different kinds of plants here. The plants are broken or flattened where you walked. The ground is soft. You see an insect walking on a blade of grass. You imagine slicing the earth like a cake, extracting a Minecraft cube of dirt and grass and insect, placing it in a vivarium to examine. You stand up, you look out at the rolling yellow expanse. How many blocks of matter are there here - you try to imagine the field separating and quantifying into one thousand blocks by one thousand blocks, but you’re unable to hold them in your head, expanding, bursting at the edges, freely tumbling now in a physics simulation, uncountably many colored pixels washing together. You lie down on the field. You briefly imagine your corpse’s chalk outline rasterizing onto the blocks of earth, but the thought fades into the sensation of the grass on your ankles and neck. Closing your eyes, you lose sense of space. You are lying down but it feels like you are upright. Your hands and legs feel far away.
